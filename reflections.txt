Your response goes here!

What new skills have you learned?
Of course, I have been learning the HTML5 syntax :)


What has been easy?
Every thing has been easy...until now!


What has been difficult?
I wanted to start and finish this project a few days ago but during the week I had some extra activities. So, I now realize that in a self-paced course the difficult part is to organize your time and try to work every day :)


How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
In general, I have been using the Mozilla Developer Network page for all my researches.
